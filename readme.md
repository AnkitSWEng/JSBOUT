## Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It has grown rapidly in popularity because it uses JavaScript for both client-side and server-side code, making it an excellent choice for full-stack development. With a vast library of modules, Node.js powers many applications worldwide, from real-time applications to APIs.
